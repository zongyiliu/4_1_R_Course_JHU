Question 2
The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition?  Select all that apply.

0 / 1 point

The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.

Correct
This is not part of the free software definition. Freedoms 1 and 3 require access to the source code.


The freedom to sell the software for any price.

Correct
This is not part of the free software definition. The free software definition does not mention anything about selling software (although it does not disallow it).


The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.


The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.


The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

This should not be selected
This is freedom 2.


The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.


The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

Question 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object `x' as determined by the `class()' function?

1 / 1 point

matrix


list


integer


complex


real


numeric


vector

Correct
5.
Question 5
What is the class of the object defined by the expression x <- c(4, "a", TRUE)?

0 / 1 point

logical


numeric


mixed


integer


character

Incorrect
The character class is the "lowest common denominator" here and so all elements will be coerced into that class.

6.
Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

1 / 1 point

a 3 by 3 matrix


a 3 by 2 matrix


a vector of length 2


a matrix with two rows and three columns


a vector of length 3


a 2 by 2 matrix

Correct
The 'rbind' function treats vectors as if they were rows of a matrix. It then takes those vectors and binds them together row-wise to create a matrix.

7.
Question 7
A key property of vectors in R is that

0 / 1 point

a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions


elements of a vector all must be of the same class


elements of a vector can only be character or numeric


the length of a vector must be less than 32,768


elements of a vector can be of different classes

Incorrect
8.
Question 8

Correct
10.
Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

1 / 1 point

x[x %in% 1:5] <- 0

Correct
You can create a logical vector with the expression x %in% 1:5 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.


x[x == 0] <- 6


x[x > 6] <- 0


x[x <= 5] <- 0

Correct
You can create a logical vector with the expression x <= 5 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.


x[x > 0] <- 6


x[x == 0] < 6


x[x >= 6] <- 0


x[x < 6] == 0


x[x != 6] <- 0


x[x < 6] <- 0

Correct
You can create a logical vector with the expression x < 6 and then use the [ operator to subset the original vector x.


x[x == 6] <- 0
